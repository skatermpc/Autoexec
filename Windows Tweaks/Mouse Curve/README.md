# What Is This?
- This simple registry change that will disable any mouse acceleration.
- By removing acceleration, your mouse pointer, (crosshair perhaps), will accurately display the movement that you make on your mouse. Therefore, making a very-sensitive mouse movement. 
- It may not have any effects out-of-game, but it is VERY noticeable ingame. It maybe wierd at first, but hell, once you get used to it, it may improve your aiming skills.
