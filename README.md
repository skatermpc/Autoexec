# CFG Files 
1. [Download](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.
2. Move [autoexec.cfg](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/blob/main/autoexec.cfg), [superglide.cfg](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/blob/main/superglide.cfg), [superglide1.cfg](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/blob/main/superglide1.cfg), [superglide2.cfg](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/blob/main/superglide2.cfg) and [reticles.cfg](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/blob/main/reticles.cfg) to the games directory cfg folder (Usually in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Apex Legends\cfg).
3. Rightclick on the game inside of Steam and go to "Properties".
4. Switch to the "General" Tab.
5. Add the command in launch options "+exec autoexec.cfg -dev" (without the Quotation marks).

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `+exec` | Executes a cfg file on startup |
| `-dev` | Skips EA intro on startup, can cause HUD flicker issues on NVIDIA cards |

# Videoconfig
6. Press Win+R while you are on your desktop.
7. Paste this inside the Run box: "%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\Respawn\Apex\local" (without the Quotation marks).
8. Move [videoconfig.txt](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/blob/main/videoconfig.txt) in it.
9. For Origin users make sure your Origin Cloud Sync is disabled in the origin settings [example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83518657/144322691-c250563c-93af-4163-a93f-09936fc234a7.png) (Start the game with local saves).

# Forced Timer 
10. Move [Memory Cleaner](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/tree/main/Memory%20Cleaner) to "C:\Program Files" or somewhere safe.

# Consistant Frame Caping
11. In-game cap or RTSS but now RTSS is optional  
- In-game cap, Change fps_max 0 (in [autoexec.cfg](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/blob/main/autoexec.cfg) and [superglide2.cfg](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/blob/main/superglide2.cfg)) to your monitor hz because [here](https://youtu.be/_73gFgNrYVQ) (Lowest latency)
- [RTSS](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download.html) for framerate caping and it is the best in frametime consistancy (Adds some latency but smoother than in-game cap)

# Gaming OS 
- BIOS Settings And Overclocking Are Important (You Don't Gain FPS Magical By Switching OS)
- There is no best. Drivers, power plans, tweaks, even isos ... they all depend on your hardware, games, needs, and personal preferences. What is great for me may be terrible for you. The only way to know what is best for you is to test it yourself.
